This is a python script that uses matplotlib to create a graph based on a csv file.
To run this script you will both tkinter and matplotlib, to install these run the two command respectively:
```
pip install tk
```
and
```
pip install matplotlib
```

To run the script first download the .py file and the .txt file. (The script was only tested with this .txt, it should work with other if they are formatted the same however)
Next, run the script. (I tested using python 3.10)
A file picker will pop up, navigate to where you downloaded the .txt file and open it.
Follow the prompts in the python console, enter a number depending on which option you want to choose. (E.g. '1', '3', etc. without the single quotes)
A graph should pop-up in a seperate window from the python console showing your graph based on the options you chose.
