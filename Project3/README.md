This is a python script that uses matplotlib to create a graph based on a csv file.
To run this script you will both tkinter and matplotlib, to install these run the two command respectively:
```
pip install tk
```
and
```
pip install matplotlib
```

To run the script first download the .py file and the .txt file. (The script was only tested with this .txt, it should work with other if they are formatted the same however)\n
Next, run the script. (I tested using python 3.10)
Use the radio buttons to select the kind of graph you would like
Use the drop down menu to pick the line type, only applicable for plot graph type
Click the file picker button, navigate to the data.txt file downloaded from the github and open it
Click the graph it button
When done looking at a graph close it, select new graph options, or load a new data file
When done looking at graphs close the option selection menu
